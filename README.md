# SpaceEngineers_KSK_ingameScripts

Welcome to Kozmik Space Korps! 

    I wanted to consolidate my code and decided to set up this repository for anyone to use. I am a full time electrical engineering 
  sophomore among many other engagements so I will commit my time accordingly. Bottom line, school and family first. The main intent is
  for this to be a learning environment. I am not a programmer by trade, I am decent with C# and I am always finding ways to improve. 
  That being said, feel free to comment, correct, request, or ask questions and I will respond. Just be patient with me as I am very busy. 
  
    Initially I will begin to add templates for basic functions common to C# but in Space Engineers context. The intention is to
  have some general starting points and examples of C# syntax to build upon. Per tradition the first will of course be "Hello World".
  I will be heavy on comments so it's easy to understand, if you are experienced with programming I do apologize. To begin to use 
  these scrpits you should have a beginners knowledge of coding in C#. It is important to at least orient yourself to 
  Visual Studio or whichever IDE you choose to utilize. This can seem mundane at first but as code gets more complex, without a 
  solid foundation, it will become very confusing, and you will burn out. So don't expect to be proficient right away, it takes practice. 
  I will post some resources. 
  
   Thanks again for reading my long winded speech and I look forward to collaborating / developing some cool scripts for this 
  awesome game. 
  
      I would like to thank Malware for making his development kit available to the community. My hat is off to an outstanding job.
  Keen Software also for developing such a fun game. 
  
  Coming Soon........
  
  - Wiki page with some learning resources.
  - SE API list
  - More script templates
  - Some spreadsheets with useful data for calculations in the code. 
 
                                                  Happy Coding!
