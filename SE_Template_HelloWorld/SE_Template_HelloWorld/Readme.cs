 * This script is a simple print "Hello world" to a text panel on your grid. I specified "LCD1" in searching for 
 * the text panel. So it should be named LCD1 if running the code as is. The code will do exactly as specified so if there were 2 LCD's 
 * named "LCD1" it would display the text on both of them, so keep that in mind. The search method used will 
 * return any text panels containing that specific text. This gets the job done but you may want a better 
 * method for calling a specific block. You can create tags which I will do in a later script. Reading the comments should give a
 * clear idea of the logical process that I followed. If you think about it, we do this all the time when accomplishing a task.
 *
 * Note: If you are not using visual studio, just copy / paste the code within the void main block directly into the programmable
 * block. Be sure to include all brackets.
